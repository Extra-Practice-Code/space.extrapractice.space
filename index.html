  <!-- On 12.07.2023 I (Kirsten) was home recovering from a cold, but feeling ok enough to want to call into the coding session happening that morning at Extra Practice. I made a meeting room via jitsi and asked them to pull me up on someone's screen. I then figured it would be cool to have a page where we can go to meet. -->
